### 🛠️ Languages, Engines and Tools :

I work in **C++** most of the time and a bit of **C**. For scripting I prefer **Lua**, but I also work with **Python**. I have worked with engines and frameworks such as **Cocos2d-x**, **SDL**, **MonoGame**, **Godot**, **Unity** and a little bit of **Unreal Engine**. My passion is developing game development engines and tools, so for my personal projects I try to write them from scratch using a minimal set of third-party libraries.
